            <p>This week my schedule was just too jam packed to read the latest technology news but instead I spent alot
                of time listening to youtube videos while working on projects.
                So this week we are going to explore CSS units using Kevin Powell's video! He does a great job
                explaining different units especially ones that allow us to make fully responsive designs!

            <p>This week I read an article on TechCrunch regarding the development of autonomous robots such as Boston
                Dynamics Spot
                being deployed with police forces. This raises some pretty big ethical questions that the article also
                brings up about where
                do we draw the line in giving a robot authority or means to injure humans? Take a read and decide for
                yourself.

            <p>This week I saw an article on CBC news about a chef that tried an AI's thanksgiving turkey recipie. I
                found the idea absolutely wild that AI are now even able to predict recipies for food that we would
                enjoy. The experiment didn't go so great with the AI producing a recipie that didnt quite make sense and
                resulted in a meh recipie.
                But im sure like with all AI's with repitition and feedback it could easily expand to actually work...

            <p>This week I am sharing an article published by CTV News that interviewed Mohammed Khamis who is an
                associate professor at the University of Glasgow. He was part of a team that has worked to combine
                thermal imaging sensors and AI to crack passwords on computers recently vacated by their operator. They
                tested the technique on different materials, password complexities, and even user input preferences
                showing an alarming high accuarcy, sometimes as high as 93% on weak passwords within 20 seconds!</p>
