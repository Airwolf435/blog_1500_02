            <p>This week I am sharing an article published by CTV News that interviewed Mohammed Khamis who is an
                associate professor at the University of Glasgow. He was part of a team that has worked to combine
                thermal imaging sensors and AI to crack passwords on computers recently vacated by their operator. They
                tested the technique on different materials, password complexities, and even user input preferences
                showing an alarming high accuarcy, sometimes as high as 93% on weak passwords within 20 seconds!</p>
